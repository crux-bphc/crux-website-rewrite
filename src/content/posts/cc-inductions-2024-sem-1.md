## Where do I prepare from?

CRUx is currently organising two workshops - **2K24** for 24 batch students, and **Bootstrap** for 22 and 23 batch students. If you are more of a solo learner, you may use any of the following resources.

- CSES Handbook: https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf
- CSES Problemset: https://cses.fi/problemset/
- USACO Guide: https://usaco.guide/
