We are pleased to announce that CRUx is facilitating team registrations in BITS Hyderabad for the 2024-2025 season of ICPC!

The International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC) is the most prestigious global university-level programming contest. BPHC has a strong history in this competition, with two of our teams advancing to the world finals in previous years. Our teams have consistently performed well at both regional and global levels and we are eager to continue building on this success in the upcoming season.
