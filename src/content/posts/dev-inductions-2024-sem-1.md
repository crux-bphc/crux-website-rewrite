## We're happy to announce that our inductions for development and UI / UX are now open!

For our first round of inductions, you'll need:

- At least one **non-plagiarised public project** (from courses, tutorials, GitHub repositories etc.)
- A reasonable understanding of your domain
- An eagerness to learn quickly

Here's the form you need to fill out: https://forms.gle/kKUBf2UCkBWti5ZHA. You'll be contacted through your BITS email about further rounds if you're selected.

The deadline for the form is **11:59 PM on 14th September**. That's nearly 3 weeks from now, which should be enough time if you want to polish and add things to an old project, or even start a new one from scratch.

Good luck, and happy coding!

PS: If you're wondering why Cybersecurity and CTFs are missing from the form, we're planning on doing something different (and hopefully more interesting) for it in some time :)
