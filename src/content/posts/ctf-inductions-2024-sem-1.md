Now that a hopefully small number of you have clicked on a completely random link that should have started displaying random images, downloading scarily-named (but harmless) files and made your browser get stuck in a slow redirect loop, let's talk about cybersecurity and CTFs :)

## What are CTFs?

CTF (Capture-The-Flag) competitions are competitions where a team of players solve various kinds of puzzles that loosely relate to programming and cybersecurity to get "flags", which are usually distinctive text strings with a specified format.

Despite being one of the newer formal divisions of the club, our CTF team (https://ctftime.org/team/270645) is currently ranked **10th in India** on the CTFtime leaderboards.

## Round 1 Inductions

For our first round of inductions, we've come up with Saladus, an ARG-style online challenge with beginner puzzles related to the world of CTFs.
Here's the link (no more tricks here, just the actual website): https://saladus.crux-bphc.com/. The FAQ page also has more information and resources about CTFs, which you should definitely check out if you're interested.

For the next round of inductions, we'll be considering flags submitted on or before **11:59 PM September 9**, which gives you around a week. Depending on how many challenges you solve, details about further rounds of inductions will be communicated to you later.

Good luck!
